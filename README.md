===================

This is an example website for Contao, a powerful open source CMS that allows you to create professional websites and scalable web applications.

On the demo website, you will find demonstrations and examples of some of the features this CMS has to offer.
The Contao demo website can be added when installing the CMS and is designed to help you get started with your first web projects.

Visit the [project website][contao] to learn more about Contao.


## API

The demo website is maintained for the currently supported Contao versions. 
See the [Contao release plan][releaseplan] for details. Each version has a separate branch in this
Git repository.

We also have _rolling release tags_. This means the latest commit on each branch is tagged
with the respective Contao minor release. As an example, the branch "5.2.x" has a tag "5.2" on the latest commit.
These tags enable you to install the latest demo content for any Contao minor version.

## Installation

The demo website can be installed alongside Contao, either through the Contao
Manager or with [Composer][composer] on the command line.
